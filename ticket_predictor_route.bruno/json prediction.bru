Essa democratização levou a um aumento na experimentação e nos investimentos em tecnologias de IA.\n\nPontos-chave do conceito &quot;AI Everywhere&quot; incluem:\n- A IA pode impactar significativamente o desenvolvimento de software, permitindo um desenvolvimento de produtos mais rápido e uma entrega mais ágil ao mercado.\n- A IA nem sempre será transformacional; sua eficácia depende de uma estratégia de dados sólida e objetivos claros.\n- Ferramentas de IA, como a IA Generativa (GenAI), podem auxiliar em várias tarefas, mas requerem supervisão para garantir a qualidade e evitar consequências indesejadas.\n- As organizações devem começar a testar a IA com casos de uso potenciais e garantir uma gestão eficaz de riscos à medida que a integração da IA se torna mais sofisticada.\n\nPara obter mais insights detalhados, você pode consultar o relatório Thoughtworks Looking Glass disponível no site deles.\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * USER: What does DTO mean ?\n * GLEAN_AI: Search for the meaning of DTO\n * GLEAN_AI: **Searching:** **Searching:** DTODTO meaning\n * GLEAN_AI: **Reading:** https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2jwVJFtVVApPaYh4z5ooJnHKZ1apUiClq9wnO6FFTFEnYnzdGoQgTjVms7x3JZ5ZDDGIcEgGGyYvJz52dt-2BMcNJuRMb6e6wvG3MjzY-2B-2BuITKaVQCl-2B3iBOYtgo0jLnaqv8gRi7gCPt1kt-2FcX7Wkc18AQONSBkaBAII2Jtj-2Fu5qVQV9HoGzrdiEsKJAvv2oUyN9rkeYAXMWsEeIkI8POVW6VXqQyPqFnLxn9ulqB2Q7aszHgyvDODZlHCHvoD-2F65aMAz-2FpGQS9vp80lU1JJ7T2SozmY-2FeiLeF2sORUNaUBrU06mdkIIY9H8ILsHG8BYdATLvcKx9PZ0LWgasjlkbi9rqbE8OhWlIAQDXPpEfybpvGfjet2QgjqbkxBV16FmfIAXdTstv5Z7swSPolr88e9clB70Ecc7n9i7oAeG3y-2BwLz0r2Cgbyru9D7fFjqcd1EAPIV-2F3kXXrqZ02-2FPkiS2GOG10znh0MtvowuE5MomvuX6b5s9kiuhLJZ-2FceLEiip3fmYTYoMLVoKffh5FtjuY5ttpCBsdDOuwpKDKQrN-2BTYBQ9Mla7_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2FihmyHFz0Pq9zRU6HJpuXfgRmMem97oQ8uPk2Rfp4D-2ByUB8ltuIycdR4ikZW0vtcoGuTb4I52A2dxLcUdHpkxGujWgC52i0fHNBYFUvk-2BWA7CTl2UAsM-2BiCke-2BXEJ9CGqswSgGRt0VX3dIVarD-2FAJjon4PCIHzepTZzu6-2Fh7T0eFPw-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * GLEAN_AI: **Writing:** Generating your final response now.\n * GLEAN_AI: Summarize the findings on DTO\n * GLEAN_AI: DTO stands for Data Transfer Object. It is a simple Java object used to move data between different parts of an application. The primary purpose of a DTO is to carry data between processes to reduce the number of method calls, especially when working with remote interfaces where each call can be expensive.\n\nKey points about DTOs include:\n- They help keep different parts of an application separated, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n- DTOs typically do not contain any business logic or complex behavior; they are mainly used to hold data.\n- They are usually implemented as regular Java classes with private fields for the data, getters and setters to access and modify the data, and constructors to create the object.\n- DTOs can encapsulate the serialization mechanism for transferring data over a connection, keeping this logic out of the rest of the code.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the article on Martin Fowler&apos;s website: [Data Transfer Object](https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2jwVJFtVVApPaYh4z5ooJnHKZ1apUiClq9wnO6FFTFEnYnzdGoQgTjVms7x3JZ5ZDDHXCl4Q4tUubGLxKyxUj0sU-3DR9N3_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2FihmyHFz0Pq9zRU6HJpuXfgRmMem97oQ8uPk2Rfp4D-2ByUOD5d7snQKDRDnxTnVwnFo2qv0t8dQAd0UVSRIoD-2B7au0Ff-2Bb5sO3dIvIa7LsTfB8R0sIRfRssi9mjFlwLzeF19VDwkl93hhpaWlojmwgkM0qd9KUsQtB4R6g3Rypqq5Zg-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * USER: what is the DTO Serviceline ?\n * GLEAN_AI: Search DTO Serviceline information\n * GLEAN_AI: **Searching:** DTO Serviceline\n * GLEAN_AI: **Reading:** https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2j9gyXJi9S0Uzv8-2BAMn2qDSFMBShAKxy4y0vBFkR8krs1QQXcIVnTppJIWPKm7yNIfpwali5Iwb79swPKDMRrTsYeux1LoayoV-2Fe-2FLwviMzZ5E-2B8QbxT7Y3r9B3ix6z0VkvaiONLVhEBRL-2Bz3WpaqLAxmpjxFDwbjaVdt2WsHCOkus-2B-2FJbnmtyJuCheSC8lpXIaATTH8na9sdeANT3jPdqu77xCGH9UNunwjc8hAr1FEpGq2eWooqfZA7ua2xzItjfBvk-2FALV6jS-2BObrrMsfLUR-2BNEserce7AyYLyNml6D-2B65wkXq-2FMAGeclEIQF-2FW9DGkYo2mw-2BilyHfc0Mz3mAg2CfGtC6ItzgDp82SsL24P82u5uSGLqJz-2B5qosEU0thqLh6oJ0nfBwo7MkSV-2FvJny1P3EVRQeSUDO0JqDDH9kaMhttYI4ZO5mKGYMt3Wraua6Hy7l1BYsGA1doUJbh853kaR47rkXGOLpU-2BNciSDWb-2FSQ-2FGlN3J6nbkmx-2BHaaC-2BGg0w7erpTcuXjgJmd2JRziJLtCx8vL7ahFNIe-2F43ECOysvJqKb_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2FihmyHFz0Pq9zRU6HJpuXfgRmMem97oQ8uPk2Rfp4D-2ByUNb0hUQhht68HilFkYbCXlKmec-2BbzpFb2DljGbzXSSuVntsghLmLXoWIxCA-2BQJjwPkN7o5lMCnKtPtJYEIcFMStmfOd6vuKpwZ0M0wYymcpaidAHQszuE-2BczYAsuhP2Icw-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * GLEAN_AI: **Writing:** Generating your final response now.\n * GLEAN_AI: Summarize the search results\n * GLEAN_AI: The DTO Service Line at Thoughtworks stands for Digital Transformation and Operations. It was one of the global service lines focused on helping clients shift their mindset and actions to adapt, grow, and thrive in the face of constant disruption. The DTO Service Line provided a comprehensive portfolio of business transformation services, including digital and technology strategy, organizational transformation, talent strategy, and change management capability.\n\nHowever, as of January 2025, the DTO global service line has been dissolved due to its low level of profitability and weaker future outlook compared to other service lines. The DTO Europe team has moved to the newly established Executive Advisory unit, which will support clients&apos; strategic initiatives and help articulate the value delivered by key initiatives.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the internal resources and updates available on the Thoughtworks central platform.\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * USER: Please generate some interesting figures from Thoughtworks engagements in AI landscape where we have client stories associated\n * GLEAN_AI: Search Thoughtworks engagements in AI landscape\n * GLEAN_AI: **Searching:** Thoughtworks engagements AI landscape client stories\n * GLEAN_AI: **Reading:** https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2j3shQO0xdnnvrRKIjQqjRD1WDaFSphkjt3CrKnxnjEnvnGo2tXaaR1Ji4gz-2FGgqAnHLLTbZo6ozwZmSjOkRf-2BoKNR3nYS5Ym4M3r0S-2F3uqY-2FVrQvrOBG-2BWXorOc0ys6I0gu0k3L9VDn6M82v-2ByiUpUaO1f8CEYYX0E0RYfk3Qy9JplT6bZcW-2B8b88Op8wWttl-2B-2BMzWpGL0aqB-2Bh8V3-2BqAS53R-2F1tSmi77BNLhaYsoosuae77KQ5ObMkbXOzlqQdaHFtiJWUP8o0-2BiJ6SHBFbb3Kq9hBXGd3PcrHPqkRoCgb1pNVIzv89x-2Bj5CjGPsPsk70geuBw1PVjzYc1vxjgBjKA2zD-2FRMQJY7-2BR9u8THzS6N2of3FYemMWX-2BxRxxMD1oISRkN20vzxDKXbFC8WmqwG-2BBhEaaDCOLD91Khuy931giMyVWV5rrDvB6Xkla-2BtYcL7eszxYrwGQEVlR3pugOccUA4olOtbAEo-2FH2ra32VDv-2BAOECTcKbHirNg4JeJSnbe-2FzL8Ukc8hx7tfoa5xcjqwuAJ1NcP3x70ouWNBrbKw9gPAExdD-2Bp6p8B4-2FahCf6GdulUND0nYSlFGsvnKKSjVSLxurtsPpAwujrXMCBAaROs8rAy2cS3-2BLU2MKMjTY97vBZhgwSTkkYV11Q8BNc39Ou6gziC1-2Fge1fDuILiCTE-2BFkdkPwvl3kBRw-2F659l9zKKuHgGBdD9AwAjNc-2FyJ8yY3YVdnmidkeZP7UEyE-2BBuznW4oMxqZwYoH5b0TtA2twKJWRgTESG7p7yJrITmfYSIuyv3gf3Bg-2BNLBNK14INemkHhfpBtJGLL-2B-2BOqCG6pOHaeCpBGMLwIm4N0lPgoZc7cxdPGDJi1cdt7xV7IczqCcPLqGz0sfV0vSm3Pn-2FelVX8hoWm8FUKtlcIwKk-2BDeBHQanqkIeuhJodv981UlyZfwhbrDK4dgKyZFKvH-2F3ShQTShbx-2BiJrMNG0Xs5pN1tdxTzhZuFFBJ8Wy9RqWyNsALbNMROZiCle0zwZXKB5uo2ebmbeO-2BEGfMYaHUsOV7oGv6d99Eu-2FHK6VAHK63PexMGsgdQ-2FK5RwLrVkWfFrCbFzvSMHRVX0YZDg-2FZeNIcdyjNOf6qoKW6omWBLyPKmdrqIiSHMnWRlI199cuUGB8ccFGB7T2OxOnZHB-2FtvXfEQvHsCXo2Li4-2BEsowdMiw5jZMjJy3kxsWu4Pfm8-2Fbtx05vwifGwrm550VfGXFO5tcAcCFVzGzckzZbUvFxTiY25hz1CJL7z3WxeVNWKgBcesCnOpfLYutOAUQwOyJjIizWca7if9s52At2J1Q4FsZTRUdp0XfPZC3mwvbJtYexXHmYdsGEuGntJdiOn2HDRupiPoCv5hdAXXO5MQBiR5UcEg-2B9QR-2BlfM2k1ilVrEeZQ6Ee1mbaRg5I8hLSudKYgMLaGO28oA4seHJEdSHjrNehkYjyYX0-2BM0L6degRpUaHCz0glaqb5lsXEJhX8-2BGuxfMZn4QPVF88Ko66TlrZAU7NPo0dfieFKKdcTJm3RYsqRjb9kbbnoWEUDXXQI4CVU3EMPkwHlvhTg-2FF3AcOBRM72gFIf7bJdNpwpZsc-2B13YPNk9CQCWq5SZxapGARvfQt071-2FwPiCjPMAH2WvIGLGBd-2FUo3zmGyDxHdZhKNkE8bHNbQloTEySGseY9L7Wr08U25FBcRWv4hHpp66GNPp9JvCmB-2BUuSxiUrrMBdY04jZYEouaeu7RwKNwIwBviitr36p7ezyZSlasgORndli9-2FXNe5yTFgoi2OeXhT-2F1ywYzb7zPxcbRUA-3D-3DK8pm_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2FihmyHFz0Pq9zRU6HJpuXfgRmMem97oQ8uPk2Rfp4D-2ByUHuHTagXCCgFHvdbywR8jTnzQXDxNmG1SEqV-2F7bRRND7m5oclUvkoTeGzCunf6A2MqTtO414n-2FRoX0os-2F6vI8ZMFrFzYWtLvUhyBC-2FK4sjq8G8VU-2BpzsPGy6EIMXtrOeqA-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * GLEAN_AI: **Writing:** Generating your final response now.\n * GLEAN_AI: Summarize client stories from the search results\n * GLEAN_AI: Here are some interesting figures and client stories from Thoughtworks&apos;

De acordo com o relatório Thoughtworks Looking Glass, a IA está sendo utilizada para escalar negócios, tornando a IA disponível, acessível e aplicável a mais pessoas. Essa democratização levou a um aumento na experimentação e nos investimentos em tecnologias de IA.\n\nPontos-chave do conceito &quot;AI Everywhere&quot; incluem:\n- A IA pode impactar significativamente o desenvolvimento de software, permitindo um desenvolvimento de produtos mais rápido e uma entrega mais ágil ao mercado.\n- A IA nem sempre será transformacional; sua eficácia depende de uma estratégia de dados sólida e objetivos claros.\n- Ferramentas de IA, como a IA Generativa (GenAI), podem auxiliar em várias tarefas, mas requerem supervisão para garantir a qualidade e evitar consequências indesejadas.\n- As organizações devem começar a testar a IA com casos de uso potenciais e garantir uma gestão eficaz de riscos à medida que a integração da IA se torna mais sofisticada.\n\nPara obter mais insights detalhados, você pode consultar o relatório Thoughtworks Looking Glass disponível no site deles.\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * USER: What does DTO mean ?\n * GLEAN_AI: Search for the meaning of DTO\n * GLEAN_AI: **Searching:** **Searching:** DTODTO meaning\n * GLEAN_AI: **Reading:** https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2jwVJFtVVApPaYh4z5ooJnHKZ1apUiClq9wnO6FFTFEnYnzdGoQgTjVms7x3JZ5ZDDGIcEgGGyYvJz52dt-2BMcNJuRMb6e6wvG3MjzY-2B-2BuITKaVQCl-2B3iBOYtgo0jLnaqv8gRi7gCPt1kt-2FcX7Wkc18AQONSBkaBAII2Jtj-2Fu5qVQV9HoGzrdiEsKJAvv2oUyN9rkeYAXMWsEeIkI8POVW6VXqQyPqFnLxn9ulqB2Q7aszHgyvDODZlHCHvoD-2F65aMAz-2FpGQS9vp80lU1JJ7T2SozmY-2FeiLeF2sORUNaUBrU06mdkIIY9H8ILsHG8BYdATLvcKx9PZ0LWgasjlkbi9rqbE8OhWlIAQDXPpEfybpvGfjet2QgjqbkxBV16FmfIAXdTstv5Z7swSPolr88e9clB70Ecc7n9i7oAeG3y-2BwLz0r2Cgbyru9D7fFjqcd1EAPIV-2F3kXXrqZ02-2FPkiS2GOG10znh0MtvowuE5MomvuX6b5s9kiuhLJZ-2FceLEiip3fmYTYoMLVoKffh5FtjuY5ttpCBsdDOuwpKDKQrN-2BTYBQ9_C-t_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2Fij23vE1T6-2BFrS4dt9HM-2FmFGslb1ZUl0YY128qIUEeRqPRG1LaQ8AdIMvTuEadGimjOf59CdPvg7HuatZzGwGk-2BHh1iAQkpiwe6-2BoD1qfUzkktPVaMm8YdTDYoVO9lH2wRxI0mwTnEtAQkFp48Fw-2F8qgNuGhYRnCEn6DyBDeqY0fwg-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * GLEAN_AI: **Writing:** Generating your final response now.\n * GLEAN_AI: Summarize the findings on DTO\n * GLEAN_AI: DTO stands for Data Transfer Object. It is a simple Java object used to move data between different parts of an application. The primary purpose of a DTO is to carry data between processes to reduce the number of method calls, especially when working with remote interfaces where each call can be expensive.\n\nKey points about DTOs include:\n- They help keep different parts of an application separated, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n- DTOs typically do not contain any business logic or complex behavior; they are mainly used to hold data.\n- They are usually implemented as regular Java classes with private fields for the data, getters and setters to access and modify the data, and constructors to create the object.\n- DTOs can encapsulate the serialization mechanism for transferring data over a connection, keeping this logic out of the rest of the code.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the article on Martin Fowler&apos;s website: [Data Transfer Object](https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2jwVJFtVVApPaYh4z5ooJnHKZ1apUiClq9wnO6FFTFEnYnzdGoQgTjVms7x3JZ5ZDDHXCl4Q4tUubGLxKyxUj0sU-3D0Qdy_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2Fij23vE1T6-2BFrS4dt9HM-2FmFGslb1ZUl0YY128qIUEeRqPZR6avjqIVZyprqu-2Boj6xP21PgF02hcg4LOiC8HabummrH3v4U6SO6CCW1vsvbEjOpXAi-2BHuiXNI0HG9Wajw37jnujVq9zMOwkfZnaI1TeqCRpN6gn6n8ywatXpxzIoYgw-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * USER: what is the DTO Serviceline ?\n * GLEAN_AI: Search DTO Serviceline information\n * GLEAN_AI: **Searching:** DTO Serviceline\n * GLEAN_AI: **Reading:** https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2j9gyXJi9S0Uzv8-2BAMn2qDSFMBShAKxy4y0vBFkR8krs1QQXcIVnTppJIWPKm7yNIfpwali5Iwb79swPKDMRrTsYeux1LoayoV-2Fe-2FLwviMzZ5E-2B8QbxT7Y3r9B3ix6z0VkvaiONLVhEBRL-2Bz3WpaqLAxmpjxFDwbjaVdt2WsHCOkus-2B-2FJbnmtyJuCheSC8lpXIaATTH8na9sdeANT3jPdqu77xCGH9UNunwjc8hAr1FEpGq2eWooqfZA7ua2xzItjfBvk-2FALV6jS-2BObrrMsfLUR-2BNEserce7AyYLyNml6D-2B65wkXq-2FMAGeclEIQF-2FW9DGkYo2mw-2BilyHfc0Mz3mAg2CfGtC6ItzgDp82SsL24P82u5uSGLqJz-2B5qosEU0thqLh6oJ0nfBwo7MkSV-2FvJny1P3EVRQeSUDO0JqDDH9kaMhttYI4ZO5mKGYMt3Wraua6Hy7l1BYsGA1doUJbh853kaR47rkXGOLpU-2BNciSDWb-2FSQ-2FGlN3J6nbkmx-2BHaaC-2BGg0w7erpTcuXjgJmd2JRziJLtCx8vL7ahFNIe-2F43ECOysvov9l_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2Fij23vE1T6-2BFrS4dt9HM-2FmFGslb1ZUl0YY128qIUEeRqPeAYi3mwYoBmacOJUc3SUkfYi8OljvGugYMpoWcSptN5MYxJOmItl8kIgeXb-2B-2B3lzMecnIN5x0vGiLyduMkq9IXgOAQc6gM8DdqBn7EG594TSoFnOVm21AoG20ydnvhlqw-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * GLEAN_AI: **Writing:** Generating your final response now.\n * GLEAN_AI: Summarize the search results\n * GLEAN_AI: The DTO Service Line at Thoughtworks stands for Digital Transformation and Operations. It was one of the global service lines focused on helping clients shift their mindset and actions to adapt, grow, and thrive in the face of constant disruption. The DTO Service Line provided a comprehensive portfolio of business transformation services, including digital and technology strategy, organizational transformation, talent strategy, and change management capability.\n\nHowever, as of January 2025, the DTO global service line has been dissolved due to its low level of profitability and weaker future outlook compared to other service lines.

Do go through the entire mail to ensure a smooth exit process.\n\nThings to complete a week prior to your last working day:\n\n1. Exit Survey: Please fill in the exit survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGxz2NBULddHdXXaAI4KWqY2yOimBbP4-7OqIpJ2QSCLE6tg/viewform?pli=1)  to share your feedback and comments about your association with TWI. Your inputs are important for us.\n\n2. Salary & Income Tax: Please submit the rent receipts, investment proofs and any other tax saving documents to be considered for the final tax calculations in Allsec Portal a week before your last working day. In the event of non submission of proofs, you will not be able to avail the tax benefits and TDS will be deducted accordingly and no further changes can be made.\n\nDownload Payslips, Tax Computation & Form 16 via Alumni Portal –\n\nParticulars\n\nAlumni Portal\n\nExample\n\nRelieving on or before 15th of the Month\n\nLogin credentials will be shared by the 1st week of the subsequent month\n\nLWD 14th December Login credentials will be shared 1st week of January\n\nRelieving on or after 16th of the Month\n\nLogin credentials will be shared by the 1st week of the second month\n\nLWD 16th December Login credentials will be shared 1st week of February.\n\n\nNote:\n\nAlumni portal will be active till the Form-16 is issued for the financial year (May or June) and one month time will be given to employees to download the form-16, after which the portal will be deactivated. You will be notified once the Form 16 is uploaded in the Alumni Portal for the Current Financial Year.\n\nYour Full and Final settlement will be released subject to clearance from all the stakeholders.\n\n3. Medical Insurance (Claims & Portability): All original hard copy documents should be handed over to MediAssist for any pending claim. Settlement of the claim is completely dependent on submission of these hard copies to the TPA. For any clarifications on medical insurance portability or your pending submitted claims, please send an email to  priyankad@howdenindia.com and remith@howdenindia.com  & TWImediclaim@howdenindia.com 30 days in advance from your last working day. Do note that any information coming even a day less than 30 days before your exit will not be considered for portability as per IRDA rules. \n\n4. Expense Reimbursements: Please ensure to submit all expense reimbursements (including per diem expense reports) at least a week before your last working day in Expensify. The reimbursements will generally take around 15 working days for processing payments and will be directly credited to your bank account. This is not paid along with the final settlement. \n\n5. Pluxee reimbursement: Please ensure to submit all Pluxee related reimbursements in the Pluxee app/portal at least a week before or earlier of your last working day. Benefits (H&W,L&D,WFH & Comm Allow) will be prorated till your LWD and will be settled in your Full and Final Settlement as “Taxable Income”\n\n6.
