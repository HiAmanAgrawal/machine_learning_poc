According to the Thoughtworks Looking Glass report, AI is being leveraged to scale businesses by making AI available, accessible, and applicable to more people. This democratization has led to a surge in experimentation and investments in AI technologies.\n\nKey points from the &quot;AI Everywhere&quot; concept include:\n- AI can significantly impact software development, enabling faster product development and market delivery.\n- AI won&apos;t always be transformational; its effectiveness depends on having a solid data strategy and clear goals.\n- AI tools like Generative AI (GenAI) can assist in various tasks but require supervision to ensure quality and avoid unintended consequences.\n- Organizations should start testing AI with potential use cases and ensure effective risk management as AI integration becomes more sophisticated.\n\nFor more detailed insights, you can refer to the Thoughtworks Looking Glass report available on their website.\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * USER: traduza o texto acima em portugues\n * GLEAN_AI: Search for AI Everywhere Thoughtworks Looking Glass\n * GLEAN_AI: **Searching:** AI Everywhere Thoughtworks Looking Glass\n * GLEAN_AI: **Reading:** https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2jxAvn8DyD5kThoLDYIJg0bAJCyF272MgCQxzW7cmBIEDi5B4ysjIKhnGnhO8I9BkOemHu8HvoPI8lGDnbCblwV9nhsjD2RoBDlhXndaQUD06b2yqyGLphpO48yw9dvJpvTp0t4IjyNyY-2BAFMT5Wl46J5CZ-2FnUFM3tMl49OjaT97kpHkhKRXR23XZuhKkI-2B5c2drp9Q-2Fz7QMd7kNpvrMH18MoKMTsuGj0lRh1UwzSKP1XwAMkgwjdtVgBhnF0lfLnCfiKrsfGSEqT3OSaEG3F2n2yVFseM7kw6VKTGs9OHAPqiYqRkurwnG9i6MTrSdWku74EZABMzgpQf3NZsGtwvCwwW38w9zDzeplvdj-2FmVQYNVIeC4q9xGBTanp-2BuFs7CbYy4d1W2aFqrFZlgrT0J5bSsxq7-2FvFi2r8tqpN-2BCRQOH2GQUx7F0owzPtLFTMyKdpbFMmTqgVquhTBJz6ot7JlWscSNCsHXSSvm2KY4OQfACRimjazLR7PcBiwcdNyvBPe00OlDYZ-2F6aDWtaL2zcGgyKWAOirPPdTNLqGgfB0V6ofGcUjU9yuU0Rt3jmYSWlCvdVw89lAVOwkixULczm3SvnT-2BugfU2B6leC64FKip9mr6e5JvVvKNHXXYG6Ue4ivLc79lP1AckbGNZqDgNyrutmMzCIQTAfgOJ8EOp28IkQ1p-2B6eAeK5yyvqgyVZrLqSdpVmTFI5TA6ubDpRrYkedLjLBIWHE-2FPBGigrC3X5dIw-2FnVmJSgXNYyPUifAxa1Owg-3D-3Dbh0D_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2FihmyHFz0Pq9zRU6HJpuXfgRmMem97oQ8uPk2Rfp4D-2ByUCi4QsQ8223sDndCNmDIhtVMdbR9tTka5VL3573gqGWwA9QTY6DHmkau4v7g54-2Fge-2FwYwX9DDV-2Ffscw6ZFNdD82K970ek2NmfZj0UMFdI5ueMram4oISZHr64hZHpBC-2FMQ-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * GLEAN_AI: **Writing:** Generating your final response now.\n * GLEAN_AI: Summarize the gathered information\n * GLEAN_AI: O termo &quot;AI Everywhere&quot; refere-se √† integra√ß√£o pervasiva da intelig√™ncia artificial em v√°rios processos empresariais e ind√∫strias. De acordo com o relat√≥rio Thoughtworks Looking Glass, a IA est√° sendo utilizada para escalar neg√≥cios, tornando a IA dispon√≠vel, acess√≠vel e aplic√°vel a mais pessoas. Essa democratiza√ß√£o levou a um aumento na experimenta√ß√£o e nos investimentos em tecnologias de IA.\n\nPontos-chave do conceito &quot;AI Everywhere&quot; incluem:\n- A IA pode impactar significativamente o desenvolvimento de software, permitindo um desenvolvimento de produtos mais r√°pido e uma entrega mais √°gil ao mercado.\n- A IA nem sempre ser√° transformacional; sua efic√°cia depende de uma estrat√©gia de dados s√≥lida e objetivos claros.\n- Ferramentas de IA, como a IA Generativa (GenAI), podem auxiliar em v√°rias tarefas, mas requerem supervis√£o para garantir a qualidade e evitar consequ√™ncias indesejadas.\n- As organiza√ß√µes devem come√ßar a testar a IA com casos de uso potenciais e garantir uma gest√£o eficaz de riscos √† medida que a integra√ß√£o da IA se torna mais sofisticada.\n\nPara obter mais insights detalhados, voc√™ pode consultar o relat√≥rio Thoughtworks Looking Glass dispon√≠vel no site deles.\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * USER: What does DTO mean ?\n * GLEAN_AI: Search for the meaning of DTO\n * GLEAN_AI: **Searching:** **Searching:** DTODTO meaning\n * GLEAN_AI: **Reading:** https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2jwVJFtVVApPaYh4z5ooJnHKZ1apUiClq9wnO6FFTFEnYnzdGoQgTjVms7x3JZ5ZDDGIcEgGGyYvJz52dt-2BMcNJuRMb6e6wvG3MjzY-2B-2BuITKaVQCl-2B3iBOYtgo0jLnaqv8gRi7gCPt1kt-2FcX7Wkc18AQONSBkaBAII2Jtj-2Fu5qVQV9HoGzrdiEsKJAvv2oUyN9rkeYAXMWsEeIkI8POVW6VXqQyPqFnLxn9ulqB2Q7aszHgyvDODZlHCHvoD-2F65aMAz-2FpGQS9vp80lU1JJ7T2SozmY-2FeiLeF2sORUNaUBrU06mdkIIY9H8ILsHG8BYdATLvcKx9PZ0LWgasjlkbi9rqbE8OhWlIAQDXPpEfybpvGfjet2QgjqbkxBV16FmfIAXdTstv5Z7swSPolr88e9clB70Ecc7n9i7oAeG3y-2BwLz0r2Cgbyru9D7fFjqcd1EAPIV-2F3kXXrqZ02-2FPkiS2GOG10znh0MtvowuE5MomvuX6b5s9kiuhLJZ-2FceLEiip3fmYTYoMLVoKffh5FtjuY5ttpCBsdDOuwpKDKQrN-2BTYBQ9Mla7_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2FihmyHFz0Pq9zRU6HJpuXfgRmMem97oQ8uPk2Rfp4D-2ByUB8ltuIycdR4ikZW0vtcoGuTb4I52A2dxLcUdHpkxGujWgC52i0fHNBYFUvk-2BWA7CTl2UAsM-2BiCke-2BXEJ9CGqswSgGRt0VX3dIVarD-2FAJjon4PCIHzepTZzu6-2Fh7T0eFPw-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * GLEAN_AI: **Writing:** Generating your final response now.\n * GLEAN_AI: Summarize the findings on DTO\n * GLEAN_AI: DTO stands for Data Transfer Object. It is a simple Java object used to move data between different parts of an application. The primary purpose of a DTO is to carry data between processes to reduce the number of method calls, especially when working with remote interfaces where each call can be expensive.\n\nKey points about DTOs include:\n- They help keep different parts of an application separated, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n- DTOs typically do not contain any business logic or complex behavior; they are mainly used to hold data.\n- They are usually implemented as regular Java classes with private fields for the data, getters and setters to access and modify the data, and constructors to create the object.\n- DTOs can encapsulate the serialization mechanism for transferring data over a connection, keeping this logic out of the rest of the code.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the article on Martin Fowler&apos;s website: [Data Transfer Object](https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2jwVJFtVVApPaYh4z5ooJnHKZ1apUiClq9wnO6FFTFEnYnzdGoQgTjVms7x3JZ5ZDDHXCl4Q4tUubGLxKyxUj0sU-3DR9N3_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2FihmyHFz0Pq9zRU6HJpuXfgRmMem97oQ8uPk2Rfp4D-2ByUOD5d7snQKDRDnxTnVwnFo2qv0t8dQAd0UVSRIoD-2B7au0Ff-2Bb5sO3dIvIa7LsTfB8R0sIRfRssi9mjFlwLzeF19VDwkl93hhpaWlojmwgkM0qd9KUsQtB4R6g3Rypqq5Zg-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * USER: what is the DTO Serviceline ?\n * GLEAN_AI: Search DTO Serviceline information\n * GLEAN_AI: **Searching:** DTO Serviceline\n * GLEAN_AI: **Reading:** https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2j9gyXJi9S0Uzv8-2BAMn2qDSFMBShAKxy4y0vBFkR8krs1QQXcIVnTppJIWPKm7yNIfpwali5Iwb79swPKDMRrTsYeux1LoayoV-2Fe-2FLwviMzZ5E-2B8QbxT7Y3r9B3ix6z0VkvaiONLVhEBRL-2Bz3WpaqLAxmpjxFDwbjaVdt2WsHCOkus-2B-2FJbnmtyJuCheSC8lpXIaATTH8na9sdeANT3jPdqu77xCGH9UNunwjc8hAr1FEpGq2eWooqfZA7ua2xzItjfBvk-2FALV6jS-2BObrrMsfLUR-2BNEserce7AyYLyNml6D-2B65wkXq-2FMAGeclEIQF-2FW9DGkYo2mw-2BilyHfc0Mz3mAg2CfGtC6ItzgDp82SsL24P82u5uSGLqJz-2B5qosEU0thqLh6oJ0nfBwo7MkSV-2FvJny1P3EVRQeSUDO0JqDDH9kaMhttYI4ZO5mKGYMt3Wraua6Hy7l1BYsGA1doUJbh853kaR47rkXGOLpU-2BNciSDWb-2FSQ-2FGlN3J6nbkmx-2BHaaC-2BGg0w7erpTcuXjgJmd2JRziJLtCx8vL7ahFNIe-2F43ECOysvJqKb_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2FihmyHFz0Pq9zRU6HJpuXfgRmMem97oQ8uPk2Rfp4D-2ByUNb0hUQhht68HilFkYbCXlKmec-2BbzpFb2DljGbzXSSuVntsghLmLXoWIxCA-2BQJjwPkN7o5lMCnKtPtJYEIcFMStmfOd6vuKpwZ0M0wYymcpaidAHQszuE-2BczYAsuhP2Icw-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * GLEAN_AI: **Writing:** Generating your final response now.\n * GLEAN_AI: Summarize the search results\n * GLEAN_AI: The DTO Service Line at Thoughtworks stands for Digital Transformation and Operations. It was one of the global service lines focused on helping clients shift their mindset and actions to adapt, grow, and thrive in the face of constant disruption. The DTO Service Line provided a comprehensive portfolio of business transformation services, including digital and technology strategy, organizational transformation, talent strategy, and change management capability.\n\nHowever, as of January 2025, the DTO global service line has been dissolved due to its low level of profitability and weaker future outlook compared to other service lines. The DTO Europe team has moved to the newly established Executive Advisory unit, which will support clients&apos; strategic initiatives and help articulate the value delivered by key initiatives.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the internal resources and updates available on the Thoughtworks central platform.\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * USER: Please generate some interesting figures from Thoughtworks engagements in AI landscape where we have client stories associated\n * GLEAN_AI: Search Thoughtworks engagements in AI landscape\n * GLEAN_AI: **Searching:** Thoughtworks engagements AI landscape client stories\n * GLEAN_AI: **Reading:** https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2j3shQO0xdnnvrRKIjQqjRD1WDaFSphkjt3CrKnxnjEnvnGo2tXaaR1Ji4gz-2FGgqAnHLLTbZo6ozwZmSjOkRf-2BoKNR3nYS5Ym4M3r0S-2F3uqY-2FVrQvrOBG-2BWXorOc0ys6I0gu0k3L9VDn6M82v-2ByiUpUaO1f8CEYYX0E0RYfk3Qy9JplT6bZcW-2B8b88Op8wWttl-2B-2BMzWpGL0aqB-2Bh8V3-2BqAS53R-2F1tSmi77BNLhaYsoosuae77KQ5ObMkbXOzlqQdaHFtiJWUP8o0-2BiJ6SHBFbb3Kq9hBXGd3PcrHPqkRoCgb1pNVIzv89x-2Bj5CjGPsPsk70geuBw1PVjzYc1vxjgBjKA2zD-2FRMQJY7-2BR9u8THzS6N2of3FYemMWX-2BxRxxMD1oISRkN20vzxDKXbFC8WmqwG-2BBhEaaDCOLD91Khuy931giMyVWV5rrDvB6Xkla-2BtYcL7eszxYrwGQEVlR3pugOccUA4olOtbAEo-2FH2ra32VDv-2BAOECTcKbHirNg4JeJSnbe-2FzL8Ukc8hx7tfoa5xcjqwuAJ1NcP3x70ouWNBrbKw9gPAExdD-2Bp6p8B4-2FahCf6GdulUND0nYSlFGsvnKKSjVSLxurtsPpAwujrXMCBAaROs8rAy2cS3-2BLU2MKMjTY97vBZhgwSTkkYV11Q8BNc39Ou6gziC1-2Fge1fDuILiCTE-2BFkdkPwvl3kBRw-2F659l9zKKuHgGBdD9AwAjNc-2FyJ8yY3YVdnmidkeZP7UEyE-2BBuznW4oMxqZwYoH5b0TtA2twKJWRgTESG7p7yJrITmfYSIuyv3gf3Bg-2BNLBNK14INemkHhfpBtJGLL-2B-2BOqCG6pOHaeCpBGMLwIm4N0lPgoZc7cxdPGDJi1cdt7xV7IczqCcPLqGz0sfV0vSm3Pn-2FelVX8hoWm8FUKtlcIwKk-2BDeBHQanqkIeuhJodv981UlyZfwhbrDK4dgKyZFKvH-2F3ShQTShbx-2BiJrMNG0Xs5pN1tdxTzhZuFFBJ8Wy9RqWyNsALbNMROZiCle0zwZXKB5uo2ebmbeO-2BEGfMYaHUsOV7oGv6d99Eu-2FHK6VAHK63PexMGsgdQ-2FK5RwLrVkWfFrCbFzvSMHRVX0YZDg-2FZeNIcdyjNOf6qoKW6omWBLyPKmdrqIiSHMnWRlI199cuUGB8ccFGB7T2OxOnZHB-2FtvXfEQvHsCXo2Li4-2BEsowdMiw5jZMjJy3kxsWu4Pfm8-2Fbtx05vwifGwrm550VfGXFO5tcAcCFVzGzckzZbUvFxTiY25hz1CJL7z3WxeVNWKgBcesCnOpfLYutOAUQwOyJjIizWca7if9s52At2J1Q4FsZTRUdp0XfPZC3mwvbJtYexXHmYdsGEuGntJdiOn2HDRupiPoCv5hdAXXO5MQBiR5UcEg-2B9QR-2BlfM2k1ilVrEeZQ6Ee1mbaRg5I8hLSudKYgMLaGO28oA4seHJEdSHjrNehkYjyYX0-2BM0L6degRpUaHCz0glaqb5lsXEJhX8-2BGuxfMZn4QPVF88Ko66TlrZAU7NPo0dfieFKKdcTJm3RYsqRjb9kbbnoWEUDXXQI4CVU3EMPkwHlvhTg-2FF3AcOBRM72gFIf7bJdNpwpZsc-2B13YPNk9CQCWq5SZxapGARvfQt071-2FwPiCjPMAH2WvIGLGBd-2FUo3zmGyDxHdZhKNkE8bHNbQloTEySGseY9L7Wr08U25FBcRWv4hHpp66GNPp9JvCmB-2BUuSxiUrrMBdY04jZYEouaeu7RwKNwIwBviitr36p7ezyZSlasgORndli9-2FXNe5yTFgoi2OeXhT-2F1ywYzb7zPxcbRUA-3D-3DK8pm_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2FihmyHFz0Pq9zRU6HJpuXfgRmMem97oQ8uPk2Rfp4D-2ByUHuHTagXCCgFHvdbywR8jTnzQXDxNmG1SEqV-2F7bRRND7m5oclUvkoTeGzCunf6A2MqTtO414n-2FRoX0os-2F6vI8ZMFrFzYWtLvUhyBC-2FK4sjq8G8VU-2BpzsPGy6EIMXtrOeqA-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * GLEAN_AI: **Writing:** Generating your final response now.\n * GLEAN_AI: Summarize client stories from the search results\n * GLEAN_AI: Here are some interesting figures and client stories from Thoughtworks&apos;

It is a simple Java object used to move data between different parts of an application. The primary purpose of a DTO is to carry data between processes to reduce the number of method calls, especially when working with remote interfaces where each call can be expensive.\n\nKey points about DTOs include:\n- They help keep different parts of an application separated, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n- DTOs typically do not contain any business logic or complex behavior; they are mainly used to hold data.\n- They are usually implemented as regular Java classes with private fields for the data, getters and setters to access and modify the data, and constructors to create the object.\n- DTOs can encapsulate the serialization mechanism for transferring data over a connection, keeping this logic out of the rest of the code.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the article on Martin Fowler&apos;s website: [Data Transfer Object](https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2jwVJFtVVApPaYh4z5ooJnHKZ1apUiClq9wnO6FFTFEnYnzdGoQgTjVms7x3JZ5ZDDHXCl4Q4tUubGLxKyxUj0sU-3D0Qdy_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2Fij23vE1T6-2BFrS4dt9HM-2FmFGslb1ZUl0YY128qIUEeRqPZR6avjqIVZyprqu-2Boj6xP21PgF02hcg4LOiC8HabummrH3v4U6SO6CCW1vsvbEjOpXAi-2BHuiXNI0HG9Wajw37jnujVq9zMOwkfZnaI1TeqCRpN6gn6n8ywatXpxzIoYgw-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * USER: what is the DTO Serviceline ?\n * GLEAN_AI: Search DTO Serviceline information\n * GLEAN_AI: **Searching:** DTO Serviceline\n * GLEAN_AI: **Reading:** https://url5756.glean.com/ls/click?upn=u001.217v2gh1298laCyh4Hs2j9gyXJi9S0Uzv8-2BAMn2qDSFMBShAKxy4y0vBFkR8krs1QQXcIVnTppJIWPKm7yNIfpwali5Iwb79swPKDMRrTsYeux1LoayoV-2Fe-2FLwviMzZ5E-2B8QbxT7Y3r9B3ix6z0VkvaiONLVhEBRL-2Bz3WpaqLAxmpjxFDwbjaVdt2WsHCOkus-2B-2FJbnmtyJuCheSC8lpXIaATTH8na9sdeANT3jPdqu77xCGH9UNunwjc8hAr1FEpGq2eWooqfZA7ua2xzItjfBvk-2FALV6jS-2BObrrMsfLUR-2BNEserce7AyYLyNml6D-2B65wkXq-2FMAGeclEIQF-2FW9DGkYo2mw-2BilyHfc0Mz3mAg2CfGtC6ItzgDp82SsL24P82u5uSGLqJz-2B5qosEU0thqLh6oJ0nfBwo7MkSV-2FvJny1P3EVRQeSUDO0JqDDH9kaMhttYI4ZO5mKGYMt3Wraua6Hy7l1BYsGA1doUJbh853kaR47rkXGOLpU-2BNciSDWb-2FSQ-2FGlN3J6nbkmx-2BHaaC-2BGg0w7erpTcuXjgJmd2JRziJLtCx8vL7ahFNIe-2F43ECOysvov9l_acYln1l294RwMzC0tKQftGo-2FfVPQAPgf9uZKgofsjk6Ovg2HaLrlVN99qgF5jQnOqBWQdMm2DBa7zwDktExybbe8u6gTYNGy-2BAHFjMlv17FNvpMCfx1NwAIvVa0FeIWX3OfdBgcpGvqnLrbDOoq55wNk9bTT0GkaF3AIyzUp-2Fij23vE1T6-2BFrS4dt9HM-2FmFGslb1ZUl0YY128qIUEeRqPeAYi3mwYoBmacOJUc3SUkfYi8OljvGugYMpoWcSptN5MYxJOmItl8kIgeXb-2B-2B3lzMecnIN5x0vGiLyduMkq9IXgOAQc6gM8DdqBn7EG594TSoFnOVm21AoG20ydnvhlqw-3D-3D\n * GLEAN_AI:\n * GLEAN_AI: **Writing:** Generating your final response now.\n * GLEAN_AI: Summarize the search results\n * GLEAN_AI: The DTO Service Line at Thoughtworks stands for Digital Transformation and Operations. It was one of the global service lines focused on helping clients shift their mindset and actions to adapt, grow, and thrive in the face of constant disruption.
